# Welcome to My Collection of Mini-Projects 

This repository is my little corner to store and share all the mini-projects I create. While many of them will be related to prototyping since this is my institutional account, I'm not limiting myself to just that. Here you'll find a bit of everything, from prototypes to anything that sparks my curiosity and motivates me to explore.

Some projects might have a more serious or technical touch, but I always try to keep a fun and educational approach. I hope you find something interesting!
